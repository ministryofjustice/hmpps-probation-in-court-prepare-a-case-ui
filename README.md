The GitHub repo for the frontend user interface for the PACFS (Prepare A Case For Sentencing) service.
The project is managed and maintained by the PIC (Probation In Courts) team of MoJ Digital.

This project is based on the MoJ TypeScript template project. More information about the template project including
features can be found [here](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDSS/pages/3488677932/Typescript+template+project).

# Instructions

## Customising the new project

As part of the automation to create the new service, various parts of the codebase will be updated to reflect it's specific name.

## Oauth2 Credentials

The template project is set up to run with two sets of credentials, each one support a different oauth2 flows.
These need to be requested from the auth team by filling in
this [template](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/browse/HAAR-140) and raising on their slack channel.

### Auth Code flow

These are used to allow authenticated users to access the application. After the user is redirected from auth back to
the application, the typescript app will use the returned auth code to request a JWT token for that user containing the
user's roles. The JWT token will be verified and then stored in the user's session.

These credentials are configured using the following env variables:

- AUTH_CODE_CLIENT_ID
- AUTH_CODE_CLIENT_SECRET

### Client Credentials flow

These are used by the application to request tokens to make calls to APIs. These are system accounts that will have
their own sets of roles.

Most API calls that occur as part of the request/response cycle will be on behalf of a user.
To make a call on behalf of a user, a username should be passed when requesting a system token. The username will then
become part of the JWT and can be used downstream for auditing purposes.

These tokens are cached until expiration.

These credentials are configured using the following env variables:

- CLIENT_CREDS_CLIENT_ID
- CLIENT_CREDS_CLIENT_SECRET

### Dependencies

### HMPPS Auth

To allow authenticated users to access your application you need to point it to a running instance of `hmpps-auth`.
By default, the application is configured to run against an instance running in docker that can be started
via `docker-compose`.

**NB:** It's common for developers to run against the instance of auth running in the development/T3 environment for
local development.
Most APIs don't have images with cached data that you can run with docker: setting up realistic stubbed data in sync
across a variety of services is very difficult.

### REDIS

When deployed to an environment with multiple pods we run applications with an instance of REDIS/Elasticache to provide
a distributed cache of sessions.
The template app is, by default, configured not to use REDIS when running locally.

## Running the app via docker-compose

The easiest way to run the app is to use docker compose to create the service and all dependencies.

`docker compose pull`

`docker compose up`

### Running the app for development

To start the main services excluding the example typescript template app:

`docker compose up --scale=app=0`

Create an environment file by copying `.env.example` -> `.env`
Environment variables set in here will be available when running `start:dev`

Install dependencies using `npm install`, ensuring you are using the current
[LTS version of node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases),`node v24` at time of writing.

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder
to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json`
and the GitHub pipeline build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with esbuild:

`npm run start:dev`

### Logging in with a test user

Once the application is running you should then be able to login with:

username: AUTH_USER
password: password123456

To request specific users and roles then raise a PR
to [update the seed data](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/dev/data/auth/V900_3__users.sql)
for the in-memory DB used by Auth

### Run linter

- `npm run lint` runs `eslint`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs the TypeScript compiler `tsc`.

### Run unit tests

`npm run test`

### Running integration tests

For local running, start a WireMock instance by:

`docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with auto-restart on changes)

After first install ensure playwright is initialised:

`npm run int-test-init:ci`

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`

Or run tests with the UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

## Change log

A changelog for the service is available [here](./CHANGELOG.md)
